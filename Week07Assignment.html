        <h2>Chad's Bio</h2>
            <p>Chad is a two year old black and white tuxedo cat who was adopted during pet adoption week 2023 from the Dumb Friends League in Denver Colorado. 
                Since Chad's actual birthday is unknown, we have decided his birthday is going to be his adoption day of March 7th. 
                Chad was neutered later in life compared to most cats, resulting in a thick neck and wide tomcat cheeks.  He is very affectionate and loves taking naps
                in laps while receiving pets and chin scratches.  Like most pets, he is a very food driven animal.  Below we will list some of Chad's favorite foods
                as well as provide a table of his feeding schedule.</p>

            <h3>Chad's Feeding Schedule</h3>
            <img src="Assets/ChadEating.jpg" alt="ChadEeating" height="400" width="300">
                <p>Chad is fed dry food with an automatic feeder twice a day, as well as wet food manually by his owners twice a day.  We found that more frequent feedings
                    with lower portions reduced Chad's irritability as well as improved his energy levels throughout the day.  The automatic feeder also allows us to be more 
                    consistant with Chad's feedings without it affecting our work and sleep schedules.  Below is a table of Chad's feeding schedule:

                        <th>9:00am Feeding (manaual)</th>
                        <th>5:00pm Feeding (automatic)</th>
                        <th>7:30pm Feeding (manual)</th>
                    </tr>
